# Disallowed emojis

- Hand gesture emojis: since hand gestures are widely used in all cultures, they may also have large variance in interpretation. In order to keep the specification as unambiguous as possible, hand gesture emojis are disallowed.

# Acceptable emojis

- If at all possible, emojis should have a programming related context. See [this pull request ](https://github.com/emoji-status-consortium/emoji-status-spec/pull/4) for an example.
- To better facilitate discussion, only one emoji per PR.
